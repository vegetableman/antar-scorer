        This is another paragraph! One of the factors driving this mushroom
        mania is the belief that they possess unusual and profound health
        attributes. A 2018 report from the Royal Botanic Gardens points out that
        mushrooms and other fungi have been used as medicine for nearly 6,000
        years. Whole Foods even named “medicinal mushrooms” as one of its top
        food trends for 2018. In particular, many exotic and esoteric types like
        reishi and chaga mushrooms are now turning up in powders, pills, and
        other health supplements

        In 1699, Isaac ran into political difficulty by entering a quarrel with
        visiting English officers, who in response drew their swords and
        threatened him. After local officials stepped in, it was Isaac who was
        punished, as Geneva was concerned with maintaining its ties to foreign
        powers.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDamrosch2005_4-3" class="reference"
